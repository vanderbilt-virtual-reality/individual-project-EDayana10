# Instructions
  Using the controls, recreate the ofrenda done for La Calavera Catrina by searching for items around the cabin and placing them in their appropiate place on the altar. 
# Written Reflection 
  For my individual project, I chose to create a game in which the player has to recreate an ofrenda, which is an altar that 
is dedicated to dead loved ones during Dia de Muertos. This is a celebration that occurs over the course of 3 days, from October 31 to November 2 and is a tradition that was developed by the Aztecs. In pre-columbian times, the this tradition was done to worship Mictecacihuatl, the queen of the underworld, Mictlan, and protector of the dead. Although this short summary simply scratches the surface of this tradition, many do not understand the significance of it or fully understand it. This is why I chose to make a game in which everything must be placed in a certain order. Everything in an ofrenda has meaning. The three tiers from the top to the bottom represent the heavens, Earth, and Mictlan, respectively. The items placed on the altar are relevant to the journey of the spirits from Earth to the afterlife. One key aspect of the ofrenda in my game is that it is dedicated to La Calavera Catrina, a figure made to represent those who favored European culture over their Mexican culture and hertiage, a sentiment that development in post-Columbian times. Both La Calavera Catrina and La Virgen de Guadalupe are representative of the mixing of Aztec/Nahua culture with Spanish culture. 


  Since Halloween is the dominant holiday in the United States, not everyone knows about Dia de los Muertos and just how meticulous the process of creating an ofrenda can be. Nor often times do they have a frame of reference of how they could potentially set one up. With VR, they are given this opportunity of learning hands on what a potential ofrenda could look like with no chance of actually disrespecting the culture at any time of the year since it is only a simulation. In short, the medium in which this educational information is being delivered allows for certain liberties on what can and can not be in the game.

  One of the dificulties of VR, at least with the availible assets is who the ofrenda is dedicated to and the inability to celebrate the 3 days wtih each users friends and family. In modern times, Dia de los Muertos is a tradition that is largely centered around the idea of family, so the inability to recreate that for every user takes away from the full experience that they would have if they were to actually participate.
